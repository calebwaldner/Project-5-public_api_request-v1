# Project-5-public_api_request-v1
 Project 5 for the Treehouse Techdegree

My own customizations include the following:

* Click outside the modal box to exit 
If the user clicks anywhere outside the modal box, the modal box closes. 

* Modal conditional scroll buttons
If the user had engaged a search and the employee list only contains one employee, when the user opens the modal box the "Previous" and "Next" buttons will not be present since the list only contains one employee.

* Automatic search input focus
If the user starts typing focus automatically goes to the search input. Also, if the user starts typing while a modal box is open, the box will close automatically.

* Live search / remove search button
While the user searches, the results are updated in real time. Because of this, a search button is unnecessary and has been removed.

* Dark theme
The theme has been altered to a Dark Theme.
